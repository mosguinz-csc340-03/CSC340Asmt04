# CSC 340 â€” Assignment 04

## Prerequisites

* CMake 2.21
* C++20

## Building

Build the project using CMake. There are four CMakeLists.txt. One at the root of the project (where this README is), and
one for each part.

At the project root, run:

```shell
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

Three executables will be created for each parts in their respective folder.

## Running

The executables `run_a`, `run_b`, and `run_c` will be created for each respective parts.

Run each parts by using:

```shell
./PartA_LinkedBag340/run_a
./PartB_Experiments/run_b
./PartC_SmartPointers/run_c
```
